# rebrowser-puppeteer
> ⚠️ This is the original [`puppeteer`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) patched with [`rebrowser-patches`](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-patches).
>
> 🕵️ The ultimate goal is to pass all automation detection tests presented in [`rebrowser-bot-detector`](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-bot-detector).
>
> 🪄 It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for the original `puppeteer` without changing your codebase. Each major and minor version of this repo matches the original repo, patch version could differ due to changes related to the patch itself.
>
> 🐛 Please report any issues in the [`rebrowser-patches`](https://github.com/rebrowser/rebrowser-patches/issues) repo.
